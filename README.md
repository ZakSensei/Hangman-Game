## Description
The Hangman Project is a Python-based word-guessing game. I created it to challenge my word-guessing skills while having fun. The goal of the project was to develop an interactive Hangman game that users can enjoy in a terminal. Through this project, I improved my Python programming skills, delving into concepts like conditionals, loops, and functions. I learned how to manage user input, implement game mechanics, and create an engaging user experience. In the end, I had a working Hangman game that I could play and share with others. It was a great way to enhance my Python programming and game development skills. Enjoy coding your own Hangman game!


## Installation
To run the Hangman Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git

Guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
You have a limited number of incorrect guesses, so be strategic.
Keep track of your score and guessing history.
