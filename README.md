## Description
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing challenge implemented in Python. It tests your word-guessing skills and provides hours of fun. The primary aim of this project is to create an interactive Hangman game that users can play in the terminal. This project also serves as a learning experience for Python programming and game development.
